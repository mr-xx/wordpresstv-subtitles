1
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:17,065
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:18,812
In this session

3
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:28,356
I will talk about video and subtitles.

4
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:35,711
My name is Masaya Hayashi.

5
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:44,855
I joined the WordPress community in 2013.

6
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:50,701
After that, I once spoke at a WordCamp.

7
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:56,643
This is the second time.

8
00:00:56,643 --> 00:01:02,153
Last year, I was a organiser at WordCamp Ogijima 2018.

9
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:10,103
I'm contributing for WordPress.tv.

10
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,718
On SNS,

11
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:25,314
my nickname is Haya2_

12
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:28,460
I am joining,

13
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,257
Twitter and YouTube etc.

14
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:35,353
If you could,

15
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:44,096
I hope you will follow me.

16
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:53,953
First of all, I would like to talk about the video.

17
00:01:53,953 --> 00:02:03,927
What do you imagine when you heard the video?

18
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:06,260
when you heard the video?

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,889
YouTuber?

20
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:18,730
Stylish videos?

21
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:26,474
Does anyone have heard of the word Vlogger?

22
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:29,721
Not a weblog blog.

23
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:32,486
VLOG.

24
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,214
It is the word "Vlogger".

25
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:51,435
This is a style of making videos more everyday, and using videos to express things like blogs that have been expressed with text and images.

26
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:54,880
To make everyday life into videos.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:06,025
Perhaps, you might think "Are such videos interesting?"

28
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:14,362
I believe that it would be coming more and more from now on these videos.

29
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:22,671
.

30
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:28,249
I think that the world where videos become everyday will soon come.

31
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:40,026
I think that the people can communicate with people all arond the world with videos with fun.

32
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:50,168
Again, I will talk about WordPress and videos.

33
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:54,779
I have a question for you.

34
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:57,838
What is this number?

35
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:04,881
11,405

36
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:16,788
The answer is "The number of videos published on WordPress.tv".

37
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:24,163
This is WordPress.tv.

38
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:33,671
This site is displayed when you type "wordpress.tv" on your browser.

39
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:38,150
Word Press.tv is a web service for sharing videos.

40
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,549
Speaking of web services for sharing videos,

41
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:49,862
One of the most famous is YouTube.

42
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:55,460
I think it's like that.

43
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,806
The difference is

44
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:06,812
only videos related to WordPress are uploaded.

45
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:09,643
The videos uploaded here are ...

46
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,408
Creative Commons.

47
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:16,524
CC BY-SA 4.0

48
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:26,265
Another question.

49
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:31,300
What is this number?

50
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,775
18

51
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:40,046
The answer is.

52
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:50,680
The number of WordCamps held in Japan which session videos are uploaded to WordPress.tv.

53
00:05:50,680 --> 00:06:02,868
So far, there have been about 25 WordCamps in Japan.

54
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:03,900
.

55
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,461
Not all videos of WordCamp held Japan is in it.

56
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,717
.

57
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,407
Here are 18 WordCamps that held in Japan.

58
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:25,916
However, not all session videos are uploaded for that 18 WordCamps.

59
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:36,704
You can watch videos of these WordCamp sessions. This is WordPress.tv.

60
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,201
This is off topic, but,

61
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:43,997
I want to publish videos from all WordCamps.

62
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:48,510
So, if you have data for unpublished session videos.

63
00:06:48,510 --> 00:07:00,317
If you want to share your session video, I would love to hear from you.

64
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:17,602
Next, I will talk about the workflow of the WordCamp session video is released on WordPress.tv.

65
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:22,788
The whole overlooking First, then, make a plan.

66
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:23,712
Equipment.

67
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:24,614
Wiring.

68
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:25,789
Placement.

69
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,306
Recording.

70
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,655
Edit.

71
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,686
Submit.

72
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:34,196
And it becomes a flow of release.

73
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:41,364
I will talk about video data.

74
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:53,280
This is a commercial law story about how to associate video data.

75
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,808
There have been many sort of medias that can save videos so far.

76
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:00,873
As of today,

77
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:04,586
I think SD cards are the most used.

78
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:17,392
Since SD cards can be purchased at convenience stores, etc., and they are also inexpensive, I think there are many people who know.

79
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:20,505
The video data is saved there. But,

80
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:25,266
You sould check maximum file size for one video.

81
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,298
.

82
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:35,841
Videos are typically very large compared to text and images.

83
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:39,788
Normally, when you save data on the SD card.

84
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:53,480
Please note that the size of 2 GB may not be able to save any more file size.

85
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:03,880
Care should also be taken when sharing such large data online.

86
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:12,124
The speed of the line is also important, and a lot of data.

87
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:25,497
In a short time. If you do so, there may be a case where the network speed is limited and the speed is extremely slow even if the speed limit is limited.

88
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:35,501
It is necessary to handle video data while paying attention to these points.

89
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:41,611
There are various types of video formats.

90
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:47,440
What is the most major format I think of today?

91
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,786
I think, it is H.264.

92
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:58,563
It is also called a file format extension for moving images.

93
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,327
Roughly speaking,

94
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,542
When I talk to you.

95
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:11,364
Many of the file formats such as MP4 and MOV are used.

96
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:18,812
Next is a very important point.

97
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:23,623
The maximum capacity of the video that can be up to WordPress.tv

98
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,584
1 GB.

99
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:41,806
I think the size is very small.

100
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:50,463
Therefore, various ingenuity is required to keep it to 1 GB.

101
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:55,593
One approach is resolution.

102
00:10:55,593 --> 00:11:01,353
Recently there is a size called Full HD(1080p).

103
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,335
Often used, but ...

104
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:05,142
And press. For videos on wordpress.tv,

105
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:09,330
Up to a size 720p is good.

106
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,675
I think that is appropriate.

107
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:28,370
In addition, the factor of how much movement can be expressed in time units is related to bit rate.

108
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,959
I think about this recently.

109
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,688
Bit rate is.

110
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:43,498
For example, it is often set to 10 Mbps.

111
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:51,507
However, When uploading to WordPress.tv, the bit rate must be reduced to about 2Mbps.

112
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:06,205
Next, I will give an example of the equipment lists.

113
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,198
This is me.

114
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:10,860
Last year at WordCamp Ogijima.

115
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,544
It will be a list when you were involved in the same section.

116
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,207
Video camera.

117
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,605
tripod.

118
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,604
Voice recorder.

119
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,101
Microphone cable.

120
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,266
Microphone microphone connector conversion connector.

121
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,249
Shotgun microphone.

122
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:29,111
Microphone stand.

123
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,244
OA tap.

124
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,692
It was listed because it would be necessary.

125
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:44,098
I will look at some of these in detail.

126
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:48,562
First, camera.

127
00:12:48,562 --> 00:13:00,682
In general, video cameras called handy cams are the most commonly used to create long-time videos.

128
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:04,111
Sometimes such a camera is used, but,

129
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:04,747
.

130
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:16,601
I think it's for advanced users.

131
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,769
Next is the microphone.

132
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:29,106
When recording with the microphone attached to the camcorder.

133
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:36,383
There is a possibility that the sound cannot be picked up sound well because of distance between the microphone and the speaker is too far.

134
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:43,424
There is a shotgun microphone as a microphone to cope with such a situation.

135
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:48,656
The microphone This is where there is a directional

136
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:53,800
Just in the direction of the external microphone.

137
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,642
It becomes a microphone that can pick up the generated sound intensively.

138
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:01,942
this is,.

139
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,274
last year,.

140
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:13,380
A microphone actually used on a WordCamp Ogijima.

141
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,460
In addition to this switcher splitter, video capture devices,

142
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:37,210
If you have a GPU-equipped PC, you can take more advanced shots.

143
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:45,053
Next, I will talk about the layout and wiring diagram.

144
00:14:45,053 --> 00:15:01,275
Before making a list, it is very important to make a diagram when considering the assumption that you can use it when you go to the venue. .

145
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:09,047
Even if you're probably ready, your cables are not long enough to actually go to the scene.

146
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:18,985
There are many cases where unexpected things happen, such as connector type is different.

147
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:30,593
It is recommended to make a layout diagram in advance to cope with this.

148
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:42,847
Next, I will talk about how to edit videos.

149
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:50,297
macOS, iOS, iPad OS.

150
00:15:50,297 --> 00:16:01,230
If you're using an Apple Apple device like that, you probably have an iMovie app.

151
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,826
I think that can be installed at no additional cost.

152
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:08,108
In this iMovie.

153
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:11,837
First, cut and paste a video called trimming.

154
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,099
It comes with a function.

155
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,014
In addition, it also has the ability to rotate the video.

156
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:24,857
You can export as MOV file.

157
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:29,621
You can enlarge the video.

158
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:36,197
Also called transition.

159
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:39,228
When moving from one scene to another.

160
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:48,838
Suddenly Rather than there is a cut, a function that it is a variety of production Toka or switched to take a little Toka or switched floaty curtain,

161
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:52,784
iMovie will have.

162
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:56,313
Conversely, what iMovie can't do.

163
00:16:56,313 --> 00:17:00,859
One is mosaic/blur.

164
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:05,192
There are times.

165
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:11,863
Something such as a password has been displayed in the video.

166
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:20,544
In that case, instead of cutting only that part, I just want to leave the part where the password is displayed.

167
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:25,950
In such a case, the mosaic and blur functions are necessary.

168
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:32,178
However, this mosaic and blur function is quite advanced editing.

169
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:45,666
If you want to use these functions, you will need special software or software with more advanced editing functions.

170
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:54,174
Also, when recording with an external microphone, only the left side is producing sound.

171
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,575
You might. It depends on microphones.

172
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:06,445
In such a case, iMovie can not edit. so that you can hear the sound of only one side. not both sides.

173
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:17,338
The bit rate cannot be set.

174
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:28,475
On the WordPress.tv, there is an video which introduced how to edit videos with iMovie.

175
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:32,007
There is also a video of the procedure of editing a work camp video that edits the video.

176
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,088
If you are interested, click here See also.

177
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:46,517
Next, talk to those who use Windows.

178
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:54,526
If you are using Windows, there will be an icon called Video Editor in the Start menu.

179
00:18:54,526 --> 00:19:00,777
When you click here, it seems that an application called Photo is actually started, but.

180
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:09,690
You can edit the video in "Photo" app.

181
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,343
What you can do with video editor

182
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,694
Cut and paste trimming video.

183
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:17,556
Rotation of the moving image

184
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,153
it can export MP4 file.

185
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:19,986
.

186
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:24,265
What can not be reversed.

187
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:27,700
Mosaic/blur.

188
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,440
The expansion of the video

189
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,874
Transition.

190
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:38,209
This area will be to the functions possible with iMovie, but if it is here of video editor, you can not function.

191
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,644
In addition, you can hear the sound of only one side on both sides and set the bit rate.

192
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:54,934
if,

193
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,164
like this.

194
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:59,896
If you need advanced editing.

195
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,399
For example,.

196
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,011
Take an example.

197
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:06,507
Premiere Pro of Adobe.

198
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:10,541
Black Magic Design Davinci Resolve.

199
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:15,214
These apps can do more advanced editing.

200
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:33,231
However, it is difficult to compare with iMovie and Video Editor, and it is difficult because it is an advanced high function.

201
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:44,270
However, I hope that you will be interested in this kind of apps and be able to edit videos more and more.

202
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,285
I am thinking.

203
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,585
It was not possible in the previous application, mosaic or blur

204
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:51,581
Try to hear one side of the sound on both sides.

205
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,107
Set the bit rate finely.

206
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:58,524
On the other hand, using these software, it can be easily realized.

207
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:05,900
Also in the previous introduce the iMovie and video editor

208
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,542
Be devastated.

209
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:18,806
There is no such technique as adding such a blur, but it is rather difficult.

210
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:22,883
There are also things like that.

211
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:29,893
To select the application in accordance with the necessary edits.

212
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:37,255
That's important.

213
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,400
Recently on YouTube.

214
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:58,619
There are a lot of videos explaining how to use these video editing software, so if you are interested, you can watch them.

215
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:14,069
The edited video is then sent to Word Press. When uploading to a TV, enter necessary information in such a home and post it.

216
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:20,714
I would like to say a few points.

217
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,644
For categories.

218
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:27,607
The location of the venue. Osaka today.

219
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,787
The year it was held again.

220
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:34,018
If this time, check this 2019.

221
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:41,698
And check the WordCamp video.

222
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:45,992
Automatically at the event name,

223
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:52,300
Contains information about the WordCamp.

224
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,683
It is a little small. I'm sorry.

225
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:58,011
Around here,

226
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:02,209
The event name.

227
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:12,799
In addition, no input is required for the producer.

228
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,960
If you go down the screen, it will look like this.

229
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,442
Since there is a item called the video file in the bottom of the item,

230
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,272
this.

231
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:27,102
Select a file from here.

232
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,881
Then press the submit button.

233
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:33,488
You can post the video.

234
00:23:42,656 --> 00:24:04,133
To upload such a word camp video to WordPress.tv have videos are also introduced to WordPress.tv. Please check it out If you have any interest.

235
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:08,745
There is a minimum amount of information in the contents that I put in the previous home,

236
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:15,625
but there are cases where I want to share information with some supplements.

237
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:24,564
As an example, if you want to specify the address of the actual video page called "slug" in detail.

238
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:32,739
Also, if you want to tag the video for that video theme, there is no item to enter in the previous home.

239
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:33,706
-

240
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:47,944
It becomes necessary to share information using such a sheet sharing sheet.

241
00:24:52,064 --> 00:25:00,592
Next, I will talk about work sharing.

242
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:13,578
I think there is work sharing in Web production, but work sharing can also be considered when dealing with videos.

243
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,706
First, a small group.

244
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:25,883
In this case, the word camp executive committee thinks that the movie file that created the movie file will be an SD card,

245
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:38,487
but it will be put together, cut the movie, and sometimes in the first part of the movie called intro .

246
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:43,816
Such added pictures and short video, encodes the video by editing such processed to.

247
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:48,248
And submit on that.

248
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:52,268
If you do all of this work by yourself.

249
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:54,389
There is also a word camp like this.

250
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,221
For example, in the case of the word camp Ogijima that I was in charge of last year,

251
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:04,331
since the number of sessions was a degree 5 and 6, it was possible the corresponding thing in my one person.

252
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:15,775
However, in the case of Tokyo and Osaka, there are cases where the number of sessions is 30, so in that case one person will respond.

253
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:19,050
I think it's difficult.

254
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:26,255
Another point I would like to explain in the contents of this slide is the moderator.

255
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:32,469
WordPress.tv is different from YouTube.

256
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:38,892
In WordPress.tv, people check the video when you publish the video to WordPress.tv.

257
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:48,133
Word Press. TV is to upload a video about WordPress, so if the content is not related to WordPress at all,

258
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:53,980
or if it is judged that the content is not suitable for the WordPress community,

259
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,362
the video may not be released There is.

260
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:06,208
It is the moderator who performs such work.

261
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:11,262
There are about 30 to 40 moderators in the world.

262
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:20,070
Two people including me in Japan.

263
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:26,149
Next, I will tell you an a case of a large number of people.

264
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:33,998
Share the previous work in this way. First, the person who uploads the shot video to the cloud.

265
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:39,561
Next, do you create an information organization sheet?

266
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:44,632
Next, the person who creates the intro.

267
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:49,626
Finally, it takes video editing and submitting.

268
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,639
Each can involve multiple people.

269
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,304
The work management of these people is ...

270
00:27:57,304 --> 00:28:05,312
You can do that using a spreadsheet like the one you just mentioned.

271
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:13,454
By corresponding in this manner, without delay video editing even with a larger word camp

272
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:23,393
I think we can proceed.

273
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:37,618
Next, I will talk about subtitles.

274
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:42,159
Speaking of subtitles, for example, when you go to a movie theater to watch a movie.

275
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,056
Japanese subtitles are added to words spoken in English.

276
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:51,272
I think this is the most familiar subtitle for Japanese people.

277
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:58,297
Needless to say, the contents of the English session can be understood in Japanese.

278
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:01,544
There is a significance.

279
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:05,172
However,.

280
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:10,458
There are many other types of subtitles, each of which has significance.

281
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:14,814
For example, if English subtitles are added to English videos.

282
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:21,891
Even people who are not good at listening to English have the significance of making it easier to understand English.

283
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:33,373
You can understand the contents even in an environment where no sound can be produced.

284
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:43,514
In addition, you can also know the contents of the human it is difficult to hear sound.

285
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:47,669
Add English subtitles to Japanese videos.

286
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,856
you canl study English.

287
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:56,509
Probably in this room, but I think that such a person is not,

288
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:11,043
For those who can not understand Japanese language will be able to understand the video in English language.

289
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:19,847
The work to put such a variety of subtitles, we are in the WordPress.tv team.

290
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:24,727
Next, we will introduce an example of how to create a subtitle file.

291
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,424
The first one is,.

292
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:30,782
Edit there with a text editor.

293
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:32,637
It is a method.

294
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:34,733
Subtitle data.

295
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:41,077
Simply put, it can be created as a text file with timing and display characters.

296
00:30:41,077 --> 00:30:49,089
So, I think that can be relatively easily edit if such a level.

297
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:56,180
However, it can be quite time consuming and time consuming.

298
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:09,166
So, recently, a challenge has been made to make this work more efficient using various technologies.

299
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:16,174
Among them, what I want to introduce this time is an app called UD Talk.

300
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:31,957
This can be a little tricky to use, but if you can use it, it will be a very efficient application for adding subtitles.

301
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:38,670
UDTalk is not an app mainly for adding subtitles.

302
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,332
UDTalk is communication support app.

303
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:47,956
That is the original development and purpose concept.

304
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:54,505
However, since this app has a powerful function, it is also a very useful application as an auxiliary application for adding subtitles.

305
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:06,400
I will talk about the benefits of using UD Talk.

306
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,195
The first one is,.

307
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:15,518
It's easier than starting from scratch because it will transcribe what you said.

308
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,202
The second is,.

309
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:25,311
This means that when a person who speaks speaks, the characters are written in real time on the spot,

310
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:33,088
but the current technology often has a wrong recognition that is different from what was heard.

311
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:42,029
In such cases, multiple people can fix that subtitle at the same time in real time.

312
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,261
This is a very powerful feature.

313
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:52,745
The third. Period and comma is in sentences.

314
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,873
The fourth is word registration.

315
00:32:55,873 --> 00:33:07,580
For example, if you had a WordPress terminology, words like Word Camp probably won't be transcribed correctly with many modern technologies.

316
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:16,521
However, if you register such words, you will be able to recognize the character recognition speech correctly and transcribe.

317
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:19,707
I think this is also a very strong strength of UD Talk at the moment.

318
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:29,210
Finally, timing information is entered.

319
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:40,783
The task of adding subtitles is to make the content you paid for text and the timing of the information of the text after that,

320
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:44,333
but the task of adding this timing is also a very steady work It becomes.

321
00:33:44,333 --> 00:34:05,343
So, if you use UD Talk, the text with the approximate timing will be prepared, which is very useful as the original data for adding subtitles.

322
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:11,887
However, there are many different formats for subtitle data.

323
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:28,971
So, by doing a lot of conversion and changing the data format, you can finally upload to the WordPress.tv.

324
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:34,832
In general, it is a CSV converter.

325
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:37,113
one more,.

326
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:39,613
Web service, Amara.org

327
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:45,426
This is not necessarily something that must be this, but as an example this time I will introduce it as the most used one now.

328
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,059
CSV format.

329
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,730
I think this is probably what many people have seen.

330
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,772
Each item in the text file is separated by a comma.

331
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:06,237
That is in CSV format.

332
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:13,609
An SRT case that lacks a CSV converter and can be used with Facebook videos.

333
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:20,353
Also, SBV format that can be used on YouTube etc.

334
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:27,899
The developer of UD Talk has developed a function to convert to the format.

335
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:31,827
Here is an example of SRT format.

336
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:36,143
A serial number is assigned and contains timing information and text information.

337
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:42,401
I think that it is a relatively simple form.

338
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:50,353
Next, Amara.org.

339
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:53,521
Introducing the subtitle data editing service.

340
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:55,646
This is free to use.

341
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,929
You can use UDtalk for free.

342
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:05,807
You can use Amara.org for free.

343
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:08,467
How to read the screen.

344
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,397
The contents of the middle part are included as text.

345
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:16,779
This allows you to edit individual texts on the browser.

346
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:23,701
Furthermore, in the middle part of this.

347
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:27,484
It stretches by pulling to the side.

348
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:28,682
Here is.

349
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:30,020
As an example here.

350
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:36,021
If you are playing a taiko master game, it will be easy to understand. The letters flow from the right.

351
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:40,609
And by pressing the keyboard at the moment when the scolding person hits the letter.

352
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:46,699
It becomes an application that can put the timing.

353
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:54,946
And like this.

354
00:36:54,946 --> 00:37:02,252
Through various operations, the next is the DFXT format.

355
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:11,025
This is one of the formats called XML.

356
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:12,704
I think that.

357
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:20,891
However, when it comes to this point, I think that it is impossible to edit with an editor by hand.

358
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:23,178
This lower part, here.

359
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:28,173
"&#12428;"

360
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:39,611
This represents one Japanese character, but it is impossible to edit the changed player directly in the editor.

361
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:48,137
So, edit the data using the various tools I mentioned earlier.

362
00:37:48,137 --> 00:38:02,741
It can last to be files to upload from a form of Word Press.tv a file called TTML format, be to submit, you can add subtitles.

363
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:09,917
This form is very simple, author's name and e-mail address

364
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:16,802
Then select the subtitle language to post and attach the subtitle file at the end.

365
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:20,158
And can submit.

366
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:27,107
In the format.

367
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:35,711
Here even after the post, will be published by a moderator is to work approve it

368
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:52,533
It explained now, subtitling, and, to post WordPress.tv, also a procedure that, because there is a commentary video WordPress.tv,

369
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:59,943
Those who would like a closer look, See also here.

370
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:08,383
Next, I will talk about moderators.

371
00:39:08,383 --> 00:39:15,528
This is operated by the moderator. This is the WordPress.tv screen.

372
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:23,623
As you probably know, WordPress.tv is a video sharing site made of WordPress.

373
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:33,259
Each video will be posted as a post.

374
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:40,769
Moderators can log in to this WordPress management screen.

375
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:43,654
This moderator.

376
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:52,992
It consists of WordPress.tv team.

377
00:39:52,992 --> 00:40:00,236
As I said earlier, around 30 to 40 in the world.

378
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:08,412
Meeting is held in Slack every week.

379
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:10,854
A chat meeting will be held.

380
00:40:10,854 --> 00:40:18,153
WordPress community official Slack #WPTV channel every Friday.

381
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:21,916
From midnight in Japan time.

382
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:36,618
If you are interested, please join us as it is open.

383
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:52,553
I also communicated with the WordCamp organiser members using the information sharing sheet that I showed you a bit earlier.

384
00:40:52,553 --> 00:41:02,662
This information sharing sheet is also used to exchange supplementary data necessary for uploading.

385
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:10,538
The story so far is When handling videos and subtitles on WordPress.tv.

386
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,169
I will talk to you.

387
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:19,444
From here, I want to talk about comparing WordPress.tv and YouTube.

388
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:29,552
WordPress.tv, the size limit is 1 GB.

389
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:33,073
YouTube size limit is 120 GB.

390
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:37,926
I don't think it's a comparison.

391
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:40,325
The overwhelming strength of YouTube.

392
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:44,110
The great feature of YouTube is that it also supports videos such as high resolution 4K video, and introduce other videos that you may be interested in.

393
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:58,647
You can use the shortcut keys to decrease the numbers from 0 to 9 to jump 0% ~90% , and increase the decrease play speed.

394
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:01,046
You can move forward and back a little.

395
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:04,625
Word Press.tv will have the ability to change the speed.

396
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:09,820
However, other features when compared to YouTube,

397
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,801
It is difficult to compare.

398
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:15,800
However,.

399
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:23,142
Though my thinking, it may also risk that depends on one of the cloud service

400
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:27,371
Personally, I believe that good is to use both YouTube and WordPress.tv is.

401
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:32,916
Excuse me. Although the explanation was around, YouTube has a channel called WordPress.

402
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:38,495
This is WordPress. Some of the videos on TV have been reprinted. If you are interested in this channel.

403
00:42:38,495 --> 00:42:48,082
Please subscribe.

404
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:51,874
Regardless of the place, anyway, I want to make more videos.

405
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:56,209
The ideal situation.

406
00:42:56,209 --> 00:43:01,009
I expect that many people will be able to watch videos,

407
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:05,550
so that the motivation to publish videos will improve and many high-quality videos will be released.

408
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,763
But the reality is ...

409
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:11,830
Even you publish a video, access is less.

410
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,222
And the motivation to publish videos is down.

411
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:20,235
The quality of the video will decline, the release time will be delayed, and there will be no subtitles.

412
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:25,702
How can I make a better flow?

413
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:35,786
I opened WordPress site. The title is "Let's be friends with the world by WordPress.tv.

414
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:39,184
I created this personally now.

415
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:43,976
I made a @WPTVJP account to Twitter

416
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:50,956
I would like everyone to follow this.

417
00:43:50,956 --> 00:43:53,406
I have few friends now.

418
00:43:53,406 --> 00:44:04,476
However, the future, by which I am looking at a lot more people WordPress.tv, become the world with friends. I would like to make such a era.

419
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:10,138
I have a few suggestions.

420
00:44:10,138 --> 00:44:13,852
First, why don't you add English subtitles to the content of your session?(Like this :))

421
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:20,924
Then, there is a possibility that people around the world will be able to see what you have entered in Japanese.

422
00:44:23,906 --> 00:44:28,804
Next, why don't you premiere on YouTube?

423
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:32,234
Here, ...

424
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:40,041
I think we can create an event that makes it easier to watch uploaded videos.

425
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:44,602
Third, give feedback on the video.

426
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:47,623
There is "Like" icon below a video.

427
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:50,983
If you have a account of WordPress.com, you can "Like" it.

428
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:57,160
I'd like to ask for reactions to uploaded videos.

429
00:45:00,102 --> 00:45:00,889
There is a workspace of Slack called WordSlack.

430
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,279
Here in Japanese.

431
00:45:06,279 --> 00:45:08,089
You can communicate about WordPress.

432
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:14,290
We look forward in this #wptv channel.

433
00:45:14,502 --> 00:45:18,118
Please join.

434
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:25,961
You can find the movie that explains about WordSlack in YouTube. I explained it.

435
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:39,498
I hope #wptv channel will be a place where many people who like videos gather and communicate creatively.

436
00:45:39,498 --> 00:45:41,212

In summary,

437
00:45:41,212 --> 00:45:51,655
I will omit it because of time. I told you about this.

438
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:53,949
Now, that's it.

439
00:45:53,949 --> 00:46:11,517
Thank you for watching.
